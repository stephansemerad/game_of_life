I came accross this on a rainy day and found this was a very interesting game that has not players :) the correct definition is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway (1970), it a a zero-player game, ,meaning evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

The rules are as following:

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
